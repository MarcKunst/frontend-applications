## used framework

For this project I used Angular as framework. If you want more information about this framwork or you're in need of detailed documentation, follow this [link](https://angular.io/docs).

## Installation

I assume that you have already installed node and npm on your computer. If this is not the case. make sure you do this before you install this project. Select the links below for more information about installing [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

When you have installed node and npm it is time to get the app working. Follow the following steps:

1. install angular on your machine by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`
2. change directory to the "the-way-of-the-samurai" folder in your terminal and run `npm install`

### Development server

Run `ng serve --open`. This will automatically open a browser tab on http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/#/).
